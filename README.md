## Client

Enables connecting to the Pally.gg WebSockets feed.

The `Client` extends a basic, typed `EventEmitter`.

### Constructor `new Client(options: ClientOptions)`

### Properties

#### `auth`: `string`
- Required

Your API key. Get your [API key][api-key].

#### `channel`?: `'firehose' | 'activity-feed'`
- Default: `'firehose'`

The type of channel to connect to from the options.
- `'firehose'` is the default and is used for general tips.
- `'activity-feed'` is used for tips on a specific page.

#### `room`?: `string`
- Required: When `channel` is `'activity-feed'`

The room to connect to from the options. This is the slug of the page you want to receive tips for.

### Methods

#### `connect()`: `void`

Connect to the WebSockets feed.

#### `close()`: `void`

Disconnect from the WebSockets feed.

#### `sendTest()`: `void`

Ask the server to [echo a test message][ws-testing]. This is useful for testing your connection and events. The
`'campaigntip.notify'` event will be emitted with a test payload. The payload will be the same each time. The tip ID
will be `'TEST'`.

Alternatively, you can [press the "Replay Alert" button][replay-alert] in the Pally.gg activity feed.

### Events

Used with `client.on(eventName, (/* ... */) => void)` to listen for events.

#### `on('connect', () => void)`

Emitted when the client has successfully connected to the WebSockets feed.

#### `on('close', (event: CloseEvent) => void)`

Emitted when the connection has been closed.

#### `on('reconnecting', () => void)`

Emitted when the client is about to attempt to reconnect.

#### `on('error', (event: Event) => void)`

Emitted when a socket error occurred.

#### `on('pong', (latencyMs: number) => void)`

Emitted when a pong is received from the server. The `latencyMs` is the time in milliseconds it took to receive the pong
from the server.

#### `on('campaigntip.notify', (campaignTip: CampaignTip, page: Page) => void)`

Emitted when a new tip has been received. The `campaignTip` includes details about the tip, and the `page` includes
details about the page the tip was received on.
